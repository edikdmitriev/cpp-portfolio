# C++ Beginner Portfolio

This repository contains my beginner-level C++ console programs.
All tasks are implemented using clean and simple C++ code.

## 📁 Projects

### task01_max_in_array
Finds the maximum element in an array.

### task02_sum_array
Calculates the sum of all elements in an array.

## ▶ How to Run

Each folder contains a `main.cpp` file.

Compile:
g++ main.cpp -o app

Run:
./app

(Programs are also tested using Visual Studio on Windows.)

---

## 🧪 Testing

Each program was tested with:
- normal inputs
- edge cases (empty input, zero, negative numbers)
- strings with spaces (where applicable)

Example test (task04_count_even):

Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5

Expected output:
2
